# YOLOv3-GoogleColab
Hey! What's up, guys! Here's the Google Colaboratory notebook that will, hopefully, help you set up YOLOv3 on Google Colab and get going with it. You'll find there how to install Darknet with YOLO and all its dependencies, including CUDA and OpenCV. Then, I'll be showing how to process videos with it and train your models (which worked like 1000 times faster than my good ol' CPU).

Hope you enjoy and get some value out of it!
